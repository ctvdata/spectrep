      "0 understanding what the modern state is , is linked to understanding its historical emergence and identifying its four key characteristics , a claim over territory , external and internal sovereignty , a claim to legitimacy , and bureaucracy . a common view is that the modern state emerged when the fifteenth century absolutist state came to be seen as separate from an individual ruler (kamrava, 2012 ). defining the state differs depending upon whether the concept of force or morality is stressed , or a combination of both (hoffman and graham , 2013 ). as this essay aims to examine the relevance of philosopher , machiavelli in accordance with his view of the state , a definition based on a mixture of will and force will firstly be explored through an analysis of his most notable work , the prince . exposure to the key themes from , discourses on livy will also ensure an efficient examination of the usefulness of his ideas in understanding the nature of the modern state . to further assess the effectiveness of relevance , an exploration of scholarly texts on his beliefs on human nature will be present , along with his political philosophy , informed by evaluations of princely and republican regimes of native italy . to strengthen the critical examination , thoughts of other political philosophers , including , aristotle , rousseau , and the influenced gramsci , will be used to emphasise the inherent flaws he is often recognised and highly criticised for . <nl> italian marxist gramsci , who viewed the state as not containing just one central attribute , traced his view back to machiavelli ’s the prince , that stated there are two means of fighting : ‘one according to the laws , the other with force ; the first way is proper to man , the second to beasts ’ (hoffman and graham , 2013 ). when depicting the renaissance prince , machiavelli argued that as the first is ‘’not sufficient to maintain power ’’, it becomes ‘’necessary to have recourse to the second ’’, highlighting a dual personality of which the character of a prince should comprise of (machiavelli, 2020 ). the process of acquiring power is the main theme followed in the prince , and is the key quality several political thinkers like plato and aristotle had concerned themselves with and had considered state -power as a means to a higher end formed in moral terms . however , machiavelli adopted a different perspective . he believed the power of the state is the end of the state , specifically every state must aim at maximizing its power . consequently , he confined his attention to the means beneficial to the acquisition and maintenance of power . the main way of which , was for the existence of good arms that would have coincided with good laws . in chapter xiv of the prince he writes , \"when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states \", a statement respectable to follow not only for the rulings of 15th century italy , but also the nature of the modern state , because we know that all states have the right to insist force to ensure their internal and external sovereignty (machiavelli, 2020 ). an example in contemporary politics could be the situation in yemen whereby there is an apparent failure to defend internal sovereignty from a domestic group challenging it , which has led to not only government corruption but also a severe humanitarian crisis . though , we can compare the factor of state sovereignty and machiavelli ’s persistent use of ‘power’, it is important to realise that ensuring sovereignty does not mean a state is all -powerful, as it depends on many other factors , including the wealth of a state . the better funded a state is , the sovereignty results in much greater power . <nl> like the prince , discourses on livy acknowledges several interpretations . political theorist quentin skinner in the 1970s , emphasised the work ’s republicanism . this interpretation focuses on machiavelli ’s many pro -republican comments , such as his importance on the republican virtue of self -sacrifice as a way of preventing corruption (skinner, 1998 ). however , machiavelli ’s republicanism does not follow the typical republican premise that power is safer in the hands of many rather than in the hands of one . to the contrary , he contends that , to establish or reform a republic , it is necessary to \"be alone \". any ordering must depend on a single mind ; thus , romulus \"deserves excuse \" for committing acts of murder in the founding of rome , because it was for the common good . this statement is as close as machiavelli ever came to stating , \"the end justifies the means \", a phrase closely associated with interpretations of the prince , whereby he urges for the ideal prince to only focus on the end of his endeavours , irrespective of the means (machiavelli, 2015 ). inevitably , his political philosophy looks at politics as goal driven , unbound by morals , and is represented as unscrupulous . his perspective is in direct conflict with that of aristotle ’s who supported the close relation between morality and political actions and argued that in politics there ought to be moral goals that are to be attained (aristotle and everson , 1988 ). both aristotle and plato believed in the moral nature of the state , but machiavelli entirely disregarded this view . according to him , although morality is essential for citizens , it is not necessary for the ruler , thereby issuing the distinction between private and public morality . a ruler has primary duty of preserving the state . therefore , he has a right to use instruments of immorality like , deception and killings , for the state (machiavelli, 2020 ). the idea channelled here that , absolute morality is neither possible nor desirable in politics , can be useful in understanding the nature of the modern state when considering the resurgence of a corrupt state . for example , a corrupt state cannot be reformed without a heavy amount of violence , an unacceptable method from the standards of private morality . <nl> similar to skinner , jean -jacques rosseau interpreted the prince as ‘’the book of republicans \" and praised it for being a courageous essay that at last explained the distinction between judging the actions of princes and the actions of humans believed it showed how politics is autonomous from ethics (viroli, 2013 ). however , viroli , in general , and (2013) rejects rosseau ’s defence and argues that his interpretation comes from his desire to rescue machiavelli ’s bad reputation and to allow the prince to show consistency with the discourses on livy . although his intention was righteous , the view that machiavelli deserves credit for discovering the principle of autonomy of politics from morals , is reprehensible due to the distortion of his text (viroli, 2013 ). examples of his work , cited by supporters of the theory of the autonomy of politics , refer to human beings as well as princes . a specific example is the title and contents of chapter xv , ‘’of those things for which men , and particularly princes , are praised or blamed ’’. the idea that he is rejecting the relevance of ethics on all human beings can be viewed here . the lack of concise differing standards presented , is what makes his work invalid to cite , for the uses of the theory of autonomy of politics . <nl> if machiavelli did theorize the principle of the autonomy of politics , he would have formed a very poor concept , due to his strict ambition of rejecting the judgement of the actions of leaders based on ethical standards . viroli , (2013) believes this is a weak concept because without ethical standards to judge the actions of leaders , we would have no defence against corrupt and oppressive politicians . therefore , they should exist but when thinking about the nature of the modern state today , we must consider the reality of this in practice . <nl> underpinning machiavelli ’s philosophy and where most of his criticism is disputed from , is a particular view of human nature . having learnt from observations of numerous european leaders , machiavelli believed that human nature was changeless and essentially evil . the prince portrays a corrosive view of human nature , fundamentally describing humans as selfish , and unreliable , \"men are quick to change ruler when they imagine they can improve their lot .\", irrational , \"men are so thoughtless ’’, and greedy , \"men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony ’’ (machiavelli, 2020 ). nevertheless , he believed these natural inclinations could be moulded by social institutions and strong leadership . therefore , he took interest in the methods of leadership and how to organise a state to enable socialisation and the taming of human nature . on the other hand , rousseau believed humans were naturally endowed with pity and compassion . as discussed in the discourse on inequality and the social contract , the state of nature is the hypothetical place where humans live uncorrupted by society , citing freedom of all its citizens as its most fundamental objective (rousseau, 2002 ). although many view rousseau ’s ideal society as unrealistic and utopian , his emphasis of equality has influenced liberal thought . considering the relevance of both attitudes , in regards to the characteristics of the modern state , we can view national identity , as a powerful source of legitimacy , holding strong connection with rousseau ’s theory that the state of nature is essential in order for people to recognise their natural goodness . a state can gain legitimacy usually by some claim of citizen representation . likewise , the function of a bureaucracy to build schools allows for citizens to gain freedom through education . therefore , machiavelli ’s more harsh reasoning for the underdeveloped state , does not fully reflect the nature of the modern state , especially as we see it today . it is crude , and unjustly limits the natural good of human nature . <nl> despite its cynicism , a specific concept of machiavelli ’s view may be more modern in politics than suggested . this is the ancient custom he incites throughout the prince , of comparing humans with animals , and stating how adaptability of these is a leadership priority (machiavelli's the prince , part 7 : the two sides of human nature | nick spencer , 2020 ). earlier i touched upon the view of fighting with force as a beastly attribute . other animalistic features significant for a prince to \"draw on both natures \" are the strength of a lion and cunningness of a fox (machiavelli, 2020 ). although the concept of human and animal nature being used metaphorically to describe an ideal or reality is ancient , the emphasis that the two natures , act as resources to portray different qualities , is what brings success in a leader , is an observation we can make today . the frequent use of verbs like , ‘adopt’, ‘employ’ ‘disguise’ and ‘change’ connote a reassurance that leaders must only use these animalistic qualities on a temporary and fluctuating basis . adaptability and flexibility , not essentially prescribed in the essence of brute animal nature , are still key qualities a leader needs for success , because in ones duration of power , society adapts with new challenges that arise , of which leadership must respond to and will do so by adaptation . a close example to show the failure of adaptation and consequent weak leadership is , brexit . david cameron ’s departure , after the referendum result suggests he had no capability as well as willingness to adhere to such change . likewise , theresa may ’s catastrophic turn of events during the withdrawal process , represented by her internal government unpopularity , suggests how she was unable to instil a \"strong and stable \" leadership . <nl> overall , we can use machiavelli ’s basic suggestion that in politics , it is not always rational to be moral , as a way of understanding the nature of the modern state , but must remember to recognise this in the light of different types of morality . his emphasis on power is valid when contemplating what will bring a prince the ultimate amount of success and his idealist thoughts on the judgement by ethical standards is permissible because there has and always will be a prevalent distinction reflected in politics . his view of human nature , however , is not useful as guidance in understanding how the state should be structured , as if followed will lead to a dismal and detrimental society , shaped by our own pessimistic cultures . we have seen that social contract theorists offer a much more pleasant view of human nature , so if we truly wanted to live in a harmonious state , that was successful in all key characteristics than we should look more to the philosophy of rousseau .\n",

      "10 police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals . over the past years , there has been significant psychological research in this area , with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses , victims , and suspects to be as accurate as possible . while these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects , victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime . one example of such victims are sexual assault victims . studies have shown that only 16 -20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (kilpatrick et al .,1992). there are many reasons for such a low rate of reports ; victims are likely to have ptsd (karatas et al ., 2020 ), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews , both of which tie in with the belief that there ’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (rich and seffrin , 2012 ). this essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims ; 1 ) rapport building (holmberg, 2004 ; collins et al ., 2002 ) and 2 ) the combination of the cognitive interview (fisher and geiselman , 1992 ) and an wrip approach (heydon and powell , 2016 ). <nl> <nl> a potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of interviewing . a survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the usa , many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (rich and seffrin , 2012 ). such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives . therefore , it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn , encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents . <nl> a key element of any police interview is rapport building . rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (vallano et al , 2015 ) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (vallano and campo , 2011 ). there are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim ; addressing the victim by their name , active listening , adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee ’s body language (boe, 2009 )), and maintaining frequent eye contact (st-yves, 2006 ). indeed , holmberg (1994) (as cited in holmberg , 2004 ) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim , the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way \" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake \" and not because it was \"for the investigation \". moreover , keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport -building was used in interviews , both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co -operate with the investigation . <nl> <nl> another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (pinizzotto &amp; davis , 1996 ; collins et al ., 2002 ). therefore , not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes , but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees , an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing . <nl> however , as with any recommendation , there are a few limitations to consider . while the notion of rapport -building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (abbe and brandon , 2013 ), it is important to note that the definition of rapport -building is not clear -cut, that is , much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions . while some researchers claim rapport -building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (collins et al ., 2002 ; hartwig et al ., 2005 ; vallano and compo , 2011 ), others argue that it is defined as a neutral , working relationship between the two parties (abbe and brandon , 2013 ). with such conflicting definitions , it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport -building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential . <nl> nevertheless , a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the uk revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87 % of the time during their investigations with witnesses (dando et al ., 2008 ). this suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport -building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result , are implementing it in their interviews . therefore , rapport -building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims . <nl> <nl> another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience ptsd . around two thirds of women were reported to have features of ptsd (karatas et al ., 2020 ). this may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them . <nl> an example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the cognitive interview (fisher and geiselman , 1992 ). as well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context , reporting from a different perspective , reverse order reporting and in -depth reporting – the interview , more importantly , involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control ’ phase (geiselman and fisher , 2014 ). during the introduction , the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions , attempting to build rapport . in the ‘transfer control ’ phase , the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves . these two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (fisher and geiselman , 2010 ), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase . these satisfaction levels , in turn , are linked to reduced levels of ptsd type symptoms (kunst et al ., 2013 ) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events , such as sexual assault . <nl> <nl> while the cognitive interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (gwyer and clifford , 1997 ), there are problems with its practical application . one problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus , cannot conduct the full interview (kebbell et al ., 1999 ). another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (fisher and geiselman , 1992 ; kebbell et al , 1999 ). <nl> therefore , with these limitations in mind , heydon and powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training , as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques , known as written -response interview protocol (wrip). this approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview . an example of a wrip approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall . this written format can then be followed up with a formal interview . in terms of anonymous reporting , a wrip that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the cognitive interview techniques . for instance , a wrip for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘engage and explain ’ phase that includes the cognitive interview ’s ‘report everything ’ phase . while still remaining anonymous , it is important to still engage with the interviewee , to show sensitivity to them . thus , it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims . <nl> <nl> with the wrip approach , many of the cognitive interview limitations are addressed . by allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime , the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face -to-face interview phase , reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview . furthermore , by incorporating these two techniques together , the victims ’ satisfaction levels , rapport building , and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised , rather they are further encouraged . however , it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations . nevertheless , theoretically , this collaboration appears to be the ‘golden standard ’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing . therefore , with such considerations in mind , the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims . <nl> <nl> in conclusion , interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky . regardless of age , gender , size , etc . reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual . it is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them . nevertheless , it is the legal justice system ’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward . it is the police ’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime . considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward , this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice . both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport . thus , it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing , building rapport is the most important aspect .\n",

      "12 expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice , body language (medjden et al ., 2020 ), the language we speak (sun et al ., 2020 ) and most importantly , our facial expressions . to effectively communicate with facial expressions , humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately . here , the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises . this is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion . thus , according to this definition , correct recognition of emotion is very subjective , proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non -universal process . there are many factors that determine the non -universality of this phenomenon , but for this essay , only three factors will be discussed : 1 ) culture (widen et al ., 2011 ), 2 ) gender (spies and sevincer , 2018 ), and 3 ) mental illness (uljaravic and hamilton , 2013 ). this essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non -universal with a wide range of convergent evidence . <nl> <nl> the main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture . there has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition . for example , studies by widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (ekman and friesen 1976 ). they conducted two studies : the first one involved 88 university students from boston college rating 10 different facial expressions – first with a free label format and then with a forced -choice format . the second study employed the exact same method , but they increased the list of choices in the forced -choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking , suspicious ) and a \"none of the above \" option . they found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1 : 58 %; study 2 : 42 %), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1 : 18 %; study 2 : 16 %). therefore , this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer , meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research . moreover , free labelling tasks have more ecological validity , making them more valid than forced choice tasks . <nl> <nl> however , as with any psychological research , this study has limitations . while the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size , the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to western , us culture as they were all university students at an american university . this means that even participants who maybe were not us citizens , still had been exposed to western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus , the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the us . therefore , it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non -western backgrounds . <nl> <nl> neuroimaging research conducted by harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in -group biases influenced this activity . the study involved 3 groups of participants ; native japanese (jp) individuals who lived in japan , caucasian americans (ca) and japanese americans (ja) both of which lived in the us . the study involved an fmri scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task , viewing stimuli of either japanese or caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger ) or simple shapes that served as control . the results of this study show that in -group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala . furthermore , bi -cultural jas showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture . thus , this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition – if this was a universal phenomenon , then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case . furthermore , the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures – those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures – which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by western norms . as culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion , credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non -universal is given . <nl> <nl> another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender . research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans . indeed , a study conducted by spies and sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not . they used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos . the single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed . the adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile . the results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition . this therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion . <nl> <nl> however , it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm – a forced choice test . an issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life , people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example , via their eyes . indeed , a study by hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques , found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men . thus , this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task ) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident . <nl> <nl> mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion . in a meta -analysis study by uljarevic and hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion . the systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm , that is , participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task . the results of this meta -analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition . <nl> <nl> however , it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta -analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms , i .e. those that deal with neuro -psychological data that is obtained through neuro -imaging techniques or other physiological methods . as highlighted before , the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks . it is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used . <nl> <nl> in support of this , a meta -analysis study conducted by cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study , but their analysis included physiological and eye -tracking studies . this study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes , consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part . the eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions , especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (scheller et al 2012 ). <nl> <nl> therefore , in line with the previous meta -analytic study discussed in this essay , the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion , especially negative emotion . thus , with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour , the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible . <nl> <nl> overall , the non -universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched . the factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways ; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently , women , more than men , are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions . it also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions , it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones . that is , non -universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones .\n",

      "24 the case , smith , was heard in the courts martial appeal court on 25th march 1959 . the defendant , a private soldier named thomas joseph smith , stabbed three of his comrades during a fight , with a bayonet in the army regiment barracks . one individual had two bayonet wounds which ‘pierced a lung and caused a haemorrhage ’. on his way to the medical reception , the victim was dropped twice . moreover , he then received incorrect medical treatment , and was negligently treated by the medical staff who failed to diagnose the puncture . the victim died , leading the defendant to be convicted with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment , in relevance to s .1 offences against the person act 1861 . <nl> the regimental sergeant -major ‘put his company on parade ’ after the fight , detaining them until someone confessed . smith , as a result , admitted to the stabbing at the parade . the following day , smith was visited by a sergeant from the special investigations branch who administered a caution and requested for a written admission . both statements were given as evidence at the trial . <nl> the issue lies in the argument of who is liable for the death of the victim , whether it was due to the negligence of the doctor or the defendant ’s actions of stabbing the victim in the army barracks . the relevant law for murder is actus reus , which is unlawful killing , and mens rea , which is the intention to kill or cause gbh . the defendant satisfies both , as his act of stabbing the victim led to the consequence of his death (results crime ). smith also had indirect intention , as he may not have wished for the given outcome , but it was virtually certain to occur because of his actions . it can be said that he committed voluntary conduct of actus reus as he did have control over his actions . this can be supported by lord denning ’s statement , ‘the requirement that it should be a voluntary act is essential , not only in a murder case , but also in every criminal case as no act is punishable if it is done involuntarily ’ in bratty . <nl> the defendant claimed the soldier did not instantly die , it was rather the injuries encountered on his journey to receive medical attention , and the doctor mistreating him which caused his death . the doctor had a duty of care to attend to the necessary needs of the patient , which did not occur as he was given artificial respiration after a failure of saline solution transfusion , which arguably contributed to his death as ‘the treatment that he was given was thoroughly bad ’. the duty of care ‘was breached , and as a direct result of the breach , the patient suffered harm ’. this is supported by dr . camps , who provided evidence for the defence and stated the victim ’s chances of improvement were ‘as high as 75 per cent ’. <nl> furthermore , the defendant appealed that the alleged confessions were wrongly admitted as evidence . represented by roderic bowen qc and h .k woolf , it was argued on his behalf that the ‘first admission was inadmissible ’ primarily due to the proceedings being soiled from the threat posed by the sergeant -major. arguably , this was conceded further in the second admission made as the order persisted , therefore the fear of threat concludes the confession to be involuntary . it was reminded to the court that the relationship between the individuals must be considered as the young soldier is obliged to follow the orders of his major , so he had to obey the orders given . <nl> the crown , represented by e . garth moore , stated that the threats posed ‘were not directed to the accused alone , but to a whole company ’ so the first admission can be addressed as admissible . it was explained that the sanction was so trivial that it would be ‘almost an abuse of language to call it a threat ’. the s .36(1) medical act 1983 states if a fully registered person is judged by the professional conduct committee to have been guilty of serious professional misconduct while registered or not , the committee may direct that his name shall be erased from the register , which the medical staff are faced with in this case . with such a severe consequence , it can be argued that the medical staff ensured they were accurate in their actions to uphold professional conduct . furthermore , the action of the third party involved , the medical staff , performed a reasonable response to the defendant ’s original act . despite reducing chances of recovery , it is argued that their act did not break the chain of causation because it was not ‘free, voluntary and informed ’, as said in pagett . <nl> in cheshire , the defendant ‘shot the victim in the thigh and stomach , the wounds necessitated surgery from which he developed breathing difficulties ’, for which he had to have tracheotomy . due to rare complications in surgery , the victim died . although , the ‘complication was a direct consequence of the appellant ’s acts which remained a significant cause ’ to the death of the victim , it was concluded , using precedents from the case of r v smith , that there was no break in the chain of causation . the judge told the jury that if they find the chain of causation to be broken , they must believe that ‘the medical treatment or lack of it was reckless in the sense that those administering it were careless of the consequences ’. it was concluded that the defendant ’s actions were still an operating and substantial cause of the victim ’s death , therefore the appeal was dismissed . this differs to jordan where the victim was given antibiotics to deal with stab wounds , however he had an allergic reaction due to the doctor ’s misconduct of not thoroughly checking records , and he died . the court , in this case , concluded that the defendant ’s actions did satisfy novus actus interviens , so the chain of causation was broken . byrne j , stated that the death was not ‘consequent upon the wound inflicted ’, but for the actions of the defendant . <nl> in the present case , the court concluded the encountered negligence received does not break the chain of causation , and it is the fault of the defendant for the victim ’s death . lord parker cj , one of the three judges of the case , stated that the action undertaken by the sergeant -major was appropriate . while what was said by the regimental sergeant -major was a threat , it assisted to provide further information for inquiries to be made . he stated that an individual ’s confession beyond the court is solely admissible if voluntary , therefore smith ’s first admission cannot be acceptable . on the other hand , the second statement is admissible as ‘it is clear that the effect of any original inducement or threat under which the first statement was made had been dissipated ’. furthermore , when the second confession was made , the circumstances were different such as the passing of nine hours , the parade had ended , and the threat was spent . the change in circumstances alters the validity of the admissions therefore it is acceptable for the second confession to be addressed as admissible . <nl> according to lord parker cj , ‘if at the time of death , the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause , then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound , albeit that some other cause of death is also operating ’. it could not be due to the medical negligence faced , as ‘an original wounding is the only reason that treatment and presence in a hospital would be required ’. based on this , it can be disputed that despite the series of unfortunate events after the stabbing , the death only occurred due to the original stabbing from smith , so the ‘wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause of death ’. the victim would not be in hospital but for the stabbing , so it would be reasonable to conclude that the stabbing was the reason for his death , satisfying factual causation . this principle upheld the conviction , and the court dismissed the appeal .\n",

      "26 this essay shall address the question \"what are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology ? in what ways are they similar and how do they differ ?\". each approach has their own individual assumptions and features , some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses , but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations , with the biological approach being a more scientific , research based , utilitarian perspective , and the psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical , subjective , purity focused perspective towards psychology (singh, 1991 ). <nl> one core assumption of the psychodynamic approach to psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences . an example of this is freud ’s theory of the psychosexual developmental stages , a key feature of the psychodynamic approach . this theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development ; these are the oral , anal , phallic , latent , and genital stages (brown, 1964 ). according to psychodynamic theory , each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress , and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation . fixation refers to the id ’s inability to transfer its pleasure -seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next . without this natural progression , fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (freud &amp; strachey , the standard edition of the complete psychological works of sigmund freud : volume iv the interpretation of dreams (first part ), 1900 ), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails , as they find pleasure in these oral -related activities . at this point , the psychodynamic approach delves into the biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as ‘psychosomatic’ disorders . this is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations , often seen as a disease or symptom , and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause , be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (freud &amp; riviere , 1961 ). this core assumption covers the ‘nurture’ side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised , however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate . <nl> another core assumption of the psychodynamic approach is ‘psychic determinism ’. this is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes . this idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality . this structure is made up of three parts , the id , ego , and superego , with the id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior , the superego counteracting the id with the morality of our desires , and the ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (freud &amp; rickman , a general selection from the works of sigmund freud , 1953 ). freud ’s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as , if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures , then the individual has no freedom in their actions . <nl> one last core assumption of the psychodynamic approach to psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces . this is seen in freud ’s theory of the unconscious , which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure . the theory of the unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness ; there is the conscious which is our fully accessible thought , and then there is the preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the unconscious which cannot be accessed , both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (freud &amp; strachey , on metapsychology : the theory of psychoanalysis , 1984 ). these are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness . the id operates solely in the unconscious mind , the ego exists mainly in the conscious mind , and the superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (costigan, 1967 ). this interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the psychodynamic approach ’s stance on the idiographic versus nomothetic debate , as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness . <nl> a core assumption of the biological approach to psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience , then it must be treated as a science . in order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study , including using correct experimental methods such as laboratory , field , natural , and quasi experiments (beatty, 2001 ). these are used to test hypotheses , the data from which is then peer reviewed . this core assumption relies on the determinism argument rather than free will ; for causational relationships between variables to be identified , particularly in regard to behavior , the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (green, 1987 ). in this case , the biological is similar to the psychodynamic approach . <nl> another core assumption of the biological approach , and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach , is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes . this can include hormones , neuronal activity , and the genetic make up of an individual , as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (kolb &amp; whishaw , 2008 ). one way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur . methods of this include brain scans such as mri , ecg and eeg , and less brain -focused methods such as blood tests (kalat, 2017 ). however , these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner -most structures of the brain . to address this issue , post -mortem studies are conducted (groves &amp; rebec , 1992 ). this is a key feature of the biological approach where the brains of individuals , often with abnormal brain processes , are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains . as biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe , biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data , another key feature of the approach . <nl> a final core assumption of the biological approach to psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors . the darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology , as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth . for example , particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before . ‘ophidiophobia’ is an abnormal fear of snakes , and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (fredrikson, annas , fischer , &amp; vik , 1996 ). the evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual ’s genes (carlson &amp; birkett , 2017 ). this core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the biological approach , as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity , as well as other species . <nl> the biological and the psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses , some shared between the two approaches , some differing . whilst biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized , the psychodynamic approach uses an individual ’s childhood experiences to explain behavior , an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience . the biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses , using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (breedlove &amp; watson , 2013 ), whereas elements of the psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them , for example dream analysis (freud &amp; strachey , the standard edition of the complete psychological works of sigmund freud : volume iv the interpretation of dreams (first part ), 1900 ), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors . <nl> <nl> however , some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought . for example , the quantification of data used in many areas of biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits , and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior . the psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients . <nl> <nl> also , the biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science . this means that the research conducted by biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results . it could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research , which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results . the psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research , meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (clark, 1980 ). for example , it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the id , ego and superego cannot be directly interfered with , even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior . <nl> to conclude , both the biological and the psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions , and others that differ between the two . each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications . inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other , but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology . <nl>\n",

      "30 the stroop test , first developed in 1935 by john r . stroop , was designed to study the effect of interference when presented with pairs of conflicting stimuli (stroop, 1935 ). this original study showed that the verbal identification of the colour of a word is delayed by the word being a colour -word and incongruent to the font colour (allport, 1990 ). <nl> the stroop test shows the effect of inhibition , a central executive function used to override an immediate response to a stimulus , demonstrated by the overriding of the semantic meaning of the word shown in order to correctively identify the font colour (eysenck &amp; keane , 2015 ). <nl> it is also an example of automaticity in reading (hunt &amp; ellis , 2004 ). automatic processes are not conducted with intent , they are not able to be thought through before they happen , and do not take up any conscious processing capacity ; the stroop test demonstrates this with the automaticity involved when the stimulus is first seen (posner &amp; snyder , 1975 ). <nl> the fact that the stroop test covers so many aspects of cognitive processing makes it a significant study in the field of cognitive psychology . variations of the study also provide a range of results on which hypotheses can be based . <nl> based on past research , it is predicted that when the colours are incongruent , the time taken to respond to the font colour will be longer in comparison to when the colours are congruent . <nl> <nl> method <nl> participants <nl> 123 participants were used from a volunteer sample of aston university 1st year psychology students , ranging from approximately 18 -22 years old . <nl> design <nl> the study was a within subjects design , with each participant responding to both congruent and incongruent stimuli , this being the independent variable ; whether the font colour was congruent with the colour meaning of the word . the dependent variable was the response time for the participants to report the colour of the font . <nl> materials <nl> superlab was used to create and conduct the study , and using the superlab timing feature enabled accurate response times to be obtained . <nl> a set of simple jpeg images were used as stimuli . these showed various colour words in various coloured fonts (red, blue , green , or yellow ), with half of the stimuli ’s meaning and font colour being the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). <nl> the participants could use superlab ’s response option to input the font colour of each stimulus using a set of coloured computer keys , and once having familiarised themselves with the order of the keys they were able to respond as soon as they had processed the colour of the stimuli . <nl> <nl> procedure <nl> firstly , participants were given a full briefing on the experiment and it ’s aims , as past studies had shown that there was little -to-no effect of participants knowing the experiment aims . they were asked to sign a consent form , allowing their data to be used in the experiment report . <nl> instructions were given verbally ; however , this was unnecessary as all participants were already familiar with the experiment . participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the font colour of the stimuli , but ignore the meaning of the words shown . the participants were told to respond by tapping a coloured computer key corresponding with their response . their response times were recorded by the superlab program . <nl> the stimuli were presented one at a time in a random order , with congruence and incongruence also randomised and counterbalanced . <nl> <nl> results <nl> only 115 out of the total 123 participants inputted results , causing n to equal 115 . <nl> <table> <nl> there was a significant difference between colour congruent and colour incongruent conditions (t = 1932 .00, n = 115 , p &lt; 0 .001). as mean reaction times were larger in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition , the participants took significantly longer to identify font colours when they were incongruent with the meaning of the colour word . the standard deviations suggest that there was a high variance in both conditions , but more variance in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition . <nl> <nl> discussion <nl> the results obtained from the experiment showed that participants took significantly longer to correctly respond to the font colour stimulus when the font colour was incongruent with the word meaning than when the font colour was congruent . this is concurrent with past experiments in the same area and is consistent with the original hypothesis . <nl> the results collected can be used to explain many aspects of perception and internal processing . the fact that the semantic meaning of the stimulus words can affect the time taken to respond to the visual colour of the font supports the flanker effect (sanders &amp; lamers , 2002 ) and in turn the theory of late attentional selection (lavie &amp; tsal , 1994 ), as it suggests that unattended stimuli can influence our conscious thoughts and actions . <nl> however , there were some methodological issues with this study . in this experiment , every participant received a slightly differently worded brief as there was no standardised instructions created for the study and all briefs were given by different investigators . there was also the issue of multiple trial situations . sections of the participant group undertook the study at different times of day , different days and in different rooms . this may have influenced the results collected and should have been controlled for by having all participants complete the study at the same time under the same conditions . <nl> there is a wide range of modifications to this experiment that could be made to study the different aspects of the original stroop test , one of which is to explore the effects of context and internal state of participants on response time . again , there are several ways this could be conducted in order to produce evidence to support real world debates , one of which is to test the effects of chemical imbalances on the stroop test . although it could be modified further to make it more applicable to the real world , at a basic level the original stroop test could be conducted under the influence of various chemical substances , e .g. alcohol , to test the effects of these chemicals on perception of target stimuli in the presence of distractors . <nl>\n",

      "35 employment relations is a process of socio -economic exchange , and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment . employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer . employment relations have a major impact on the uk labour market , this statement is supported by ons report on the uk labour market which shows from november 2017 , there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed . <nl> the uk government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country . the government acts as the economic manager , this consist of setting the level of wages , tax rate and managing the cost of living . the government are also classed as regulators of labour markets , this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee . in addition , they play act as the welfare state , ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties . being the largest employer with 5 .39 million workers employed , the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this . <nl> this report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the uk . there has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market . since the beginning , there has always been more men employed them women . the office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020 , 78 .6% of men were employed opposed to the 71 .9% of women who have been employed , a difference of just under 7 %, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11 .5% ten years ago . these numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid -19 pandemic . the employment rates of males has remained around 70 %, however females have increased immensely . since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67 %, women employment has increased by around 5 %. ons suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72 .6%, showing a positive change from 52 .8% in 1971 . the changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60 -65. this increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality . there are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce , one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws , these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010 , equality and human right commission , employment act 2008 and equality act 2006 . from the start of 2008 to 2010 , male employment rate went down by 4 %, whereas for females just under 2 % due to so many being made redundant . the years following the uk recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers , but an improvement in the number of part time employees . fortunately , since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown . during recession , many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees . this process is referred to as labour market flexibility , (bell and blanchflower , 2010 ). and is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium , and was beneficial for part time employees . to have a greater effect , the uk government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession . <nl> <nl> despite many efforts for many years , gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace . the global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the uk ’s fasted -growing job clusters of the future \", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future , it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children , inevitably the future labour market . improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available , would allow women to contribute and support the uk economy . a study conducted by pwc (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality , however progress is slow \". this statement comes from results showing that the uk ’s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than oecd average . another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the uk were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as sweden , it would increase the gdp by a staggering $252 billion . this supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda , because of the great impact it could have on the uk economy . an article written by the guardian states , \"the uk has fallen from 15th to 21st \" with regards to being the most equal nation . although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market , the uk are still far below its european neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern . <nl> another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime . 8 ,424 private sector employers reported their data , with 3 ,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3 ,387 seeing pay gap worsen , and 645 employers seeing no change . this supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue . however , with regards to part -time employees women on average earn more , a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part -time and higher earnings . the state of uk has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated . companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit , this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work . as an employer , doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay . this comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010 , which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination . in 2017 , it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report , this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily . a negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report , however not actually make amendments to the pay gap . since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed , this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future , this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the uk government to resolve this issue . <nl> <nl> to help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality , national minimum wage was enacted as a plan . this is significant as this was the uk governments ’ first national and cross -sectural attempt to regulate low pay . dube (2017) found that in america for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage , over the long run , the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5 .3 percent , this emphasises the importance of minimum wage . in 2016 , national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce , however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4 .9% in 2019 , nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work . this proves that it is still of a major concern . women make up 60 % of workers on the national living wage , meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on . the fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage , would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue . <nl> <nl> with regards to public sector , the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies , this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles , uk is top in the eu and only fourth in the g20 nations . presently , the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15 .5%, which is a slight improvement , as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4 %. the most recent data conducted by ons was in 2018 , and suggests there has been an increase of 10 .9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42 .7% of female employees working at senior civil service level . this is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year . in the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels , there are more females then male employees . females still dominate with the number of civil service employees , however decreased by 0 .1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign . to prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector , the government have enacted public sector equality duty . psed \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination , advance equality of opportunity \" (fredman, 2011 ).and ensure good relations between employees . this act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum , also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty . psed has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform , as gender inequality is still present within the public sector . ons shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector , showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality . this affects the government ’s stance as aiming to be a role model , and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers . <nl> <nl> the uk government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues . there are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap , the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males , the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on . one major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the equality act 2010 , this was a good intervention is helping with equality , however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern . equal pay has gradually been improving , however still seems a long way from the end goal , a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines , ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies . to help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on , the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory . the national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females ), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage . therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this . the positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees , the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions , this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles . it is vital that the skills and potential of women in the uk are used to a maximum , as mentioned previously if the uk were able to reach the same female employment rate as sweden , it would increase the gdp by $252 billion , which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly . this shows if the uk government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers , and regulators of labour market , they could definitely help with gender inequality in the uk\n",

      "46 reviously emailed regarding my long awaited order . i received a kind response and shortly after one of the two items i had purchased arrived . <nl> <nl> as they were not too big at all , and could have both fit n one box , i was confused as to why i did not also receive it . <nl> <nl> please could you find out where the other item is , it is a red lego lunchbox . <nl> <nl> my order number is <id_number> <nl> <nl> thank you . <new> hey , <nl> <nl> yes i ’m happy to start tomorrow too . if possible could you guys check out the email i forwarded of <pers_fn> ’s response to our ideas on multiculturalism , beforehand , because once we ’ve finalised a questiontopic title , we can discuss a structure and hopefully get started on writing our parts . <nl> <nl> thanks . <new> hey <addr11_fn> , <nl> <nl> that ’s awful your phone got robbed . i hope you ’re ok ! <nl> <nl> about the group work , we haven ’t said anything and not made a start 😬 however , did you see <pers_fn> ’s email reminding us of the assessment ? well he said we do get the 5 day leeway , which is probably good for us considering we haven ’t started . <nl> <nl> anyway , remember a while ago when i said i emailed <pers_fn> our ideas on multiculturalism , i then forwarded you all his response and so if we take that and come to a structured plan of what each of us can write about , then i guess we can all get going with our 1000 words . <nl> <nl> obviously i ’ll tell the others too look at this response too , because it ’s our starting point . if you don ’t have it , i can forward it again . let me know . <nl> <nl> also i apologise for the lack of communication and not even starting it yet , it ’s kind of a shit time for me right now so it ’s just stupidly been pushed to the back of my mind , but ultimately this is a group project and it ’s completely not fair on everyone else . <new> hey , yes that sounds good to me . <new> hello <addr7_fn> , <nl> <nl> unfortunately due to health issues and how devastated my well -being was in general last term , i felt i was completely unable to produce a decent piece of work for this module . i got into contact with my personal tutor and he made me aware of the automatic deferral , the university has put in place this academic year , to allow students to defer assessments till the summer . i was told to not submit and no penalty would be given , i just will be doing it in the summer instead . <nl> <nl> i wanted to know if you had any specific information about how the assessment for this module will run for the summer deferral ? for example , <nl> will the question be different ? <nl> will it still be a the same type of assessment (case study )? <nl> also , do you know the exact date of the deferral , or when i would be able to find out ? <nl> <nl> lastly , i really did enjoy this module and your delivery of it , you seem like a great linguistic and cool guy , it ’s just a shame that things were not the best for me , and that circumstances meant we could not meet on campus . <nl> <nl> all the best , <nl> <nl> <part_fn>\n",

      "48 <addr4_nn> , <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> thanks so much for the detailed reply , i 've been meaning to get back to you for ages but placement got a bit hectic ! <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> it 's not so much that my placement has inspired me to investigate a particular supplement but rather helped me to hone in on the exact effects i 'm thinking of investigating . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> since moving to <city> i 've seen an insanely steep increase in the amount of cbd products being advertised in customer -facing businesses , from cbd oils and oral sprays in health shops to being offered a 'cbd latte ' in a coffee shop i was in recently . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> most of these use vaguely worded claims that cbd helps with sleep , anxiety , chronic pain , and a whole list of other things . <nl> <nl> in <business> i found a 60ml bottle of \"double strength cbd \" (i think it was a 600mg bottle ) being sold as a \"food supplement \", with precise dosage instructions but no hints as to what the effects were supposed to be , being sold for £68! <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> i already have an interest in the effects of cannabis on the brain and have been looking into the chemistry of its effects during my time at uni (unsurprisingly you have to special order any reading into the library ), but after some research into the process of obtaining cannabis for study at university , i figured cbd would be less of a hassle (and less of an ethical issue ) to begin research with . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> my placement has me working with people with high levels of <condition> , and i would probably focus on the effects of cbd on <condition> , this being one of the biggest 'claims-but-legally-not-claims' made by companies selling cbd products , and it 's an area where some basic research has been done which would probably make my job a whole lot easier , but comes with the ethical issue of working with vulnerable individuals . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> as far as i can tell , the research done into side effects of cbd generally support it being a safe product with minimal side effects , with the risk of adverse side effects being low enough to probably convince an ethics committee , (i don 't imagine the research would come under an umbrella ethics approval but i have not found out much about the umbrella system so i 'm not sure ). <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> the 'no underlying conditions ' thing had not occurred to me but i imagine it would be a must -have for this kind of research . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> there is a bit of an issue around what cbd is classified as in the uk , as it doesn 't seem to be approved as a medication or a food product , but looking at it now this might be beneficial as i might be able to frame it as a food supplement . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> it 's all a bit theoretical at the moment , but i think i am going to base part of my placement assessment on the idea as we have to do a research proposal poster anyway , why not make it something that could help next year ? <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> if i 'm allowed to do this sort of research practically in final year the randomised placebo controlled trial idea would definitely be the one i 'd go with i think , just seems like the widely -accepted best way to go with this sort of research ! <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> looking back on this email it looks like a bit of a brain -dump so sorry about that , but your advice really helped me with starting the methodology research so thank you so much for your email ! <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> any musings on the whole idea would be greatly appreciated , it 's a topic i find ridiculously interesting so any chance to discuss research options is amazing ! <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> thank you , <nl> <nl> <part_nn>\n",

      "58 lo <addr7_fn> , <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> i just had a question about the structure of newspapers , so i thought i would ask you as you seem to be well informed on all that stuff . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> what is it called when newspapers , print or online , write first person plural pieces that are titled , for example , ‘’the sun says ’’? i am analyzing one for that is written as a column in a print piece and want to get the terminology correct . <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> if you know , please let me know , thanks ! <nl> <nl> <new> this is the front cover . is this enough text to analyze ? if not am i allowed to feature , this column that was printed in the sun two days after ? <new> hello <addr13_fn> , <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> for my analysis , i am doing a front page cover of a newspaper and using fairclough ’s cda approach . as well as the front cover , is it ok to use the text of a column from the same newspaper but a from a later date ? <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> the column is about the same story the front cover of my analysis is based on . also , i feel like the there is not enough text to analysis just on the front cover . <new> hello <addr2_fn> , <nl> <nl> <nl> <nl> i just wanted clarification on the 3000 word <module> essay . do we literally begin the essay with the outline we submitted earlier , or incorporate any parts of it , considering we amend it with your feedback ? my outline basically introduced the essay anyway , like explaining the structure and framework for analysis . <new> hello , no worries . i ’ve decided to keep it now . <new> hello , please can you cancel my order . <new> hi , i changed my mind about the keyboard i just purchased from your site . please could you cancel it as soon as possible , thanks . <new> to members of parliament , <nl> i am a university student in england , and i am urging you as our leaders to act and speak on our behalf . as a paying student , i am not receiving an education worth £9,250 an academic year and have absolutely no safety in my degrees or future . <nl> from the start of the 2020 academic year , we have been limited to online lectures and seminars , many of us without a simple chance at face -to-face lessons in university based on your restrictions . the necessity for debating , critical thinking amongst peers , practical learning , access to science labs and technology , observative learning and several other aspects the learning process a university is supposed to give to its students , has been stripped from us . this lack of access to lectures and university resources is all under the order of your restrictions . with all of this deprived of us , we are still expected to completeproduce the same amount of work , uphold attendance , be graded , and take exams (regardless of learning style , speech , and language needs ) in the same way as the previous 2019 students , who had full access to the resources they were paying for . <nl> a -level students , along with gcse students have been addressed , given direction , and reassured about their exams and future . however , it is the university students who are paying £9,250 an academic year to study , who have not even received acknowledgement from the prime minister or the government regarding the next steps of our education . the government has not even had the decency to address universities and their students other than to blame them for the spreading of covid -19. where is the exam safety net for university students ? most importantly , how will this significantly reduced service offer affect our degrees , our careers , our access to jobs with grades and the job market reflective of a global pandemic . <nl> many students have paid a minimum of £7000 to live in student accommodation to be able to access their university campus at ease . nevertheless , the government has restricted us from accessing the same universities we have been enrolled to learn in . on top of this , the government has urged university students to stay in our accommodations during this pandemic in an attempt to lower the spread of the virus , all while allowing millions of primary and secondary school children to attend closed spaces of their school facilities to demonstrate your support of education in the uk . are university students not in need of education also ? <nl> although many of us are loaning student fees from the government , we will be expected to carry and repay this debt for many years . we are asking you to speak and act on behalf of university students across the uk . we are pleading for a review , reduced fees , and security of our degrees . many of us who deferred our university place for 2019 had almost no choice but to join university this year , 2020 . many of us are experiencing isolation and a rapid decline in mental health and emotional wellbeing due to this uncertainty , lack of acknowledgement and the expectation that we should just adapt without the expectation of support . as a democratic country , we empower you as citizens and legal voters to speak and act on our behalf . please call for a review of our academic year due to the 202021 pandemic . we are the future mp ’s, nurses , doctors , vets , lawyers etc of the united kingdom . <nl> a response to this email and addressing of universities and their students from the members of parliament and prime minister of this country will help us believe in the future you have promised and are fighting to achieve for us . <nl> thank you for reading . <nl> yours faithfully , a university student of 20202021\n",

      "72 the parties involved ; alder hey children ’s nhs foundation trust , mr thomas evans , ms kate james and alfie evans . the first case , alder hey children ’s nhs foundation trust v evans , was in the family division of the high court of justice which considers ‘declarations in medical treatment cases ’. alfie was ‘terminally ill with a severe and progressive neurodegenerative condition ’ with ‘simply no prospect of recovery ’. <nl> <nl> since parties were unable to decide the terms of an end of life plan , it was decided ‘the matter shall be listed before hayden j ’. represented by mr diamond , a writ of ‘habeas corpus ’ was requested to ‘release alfie from his hospital bed ’ arguing he was ‘unlawfully detained ’. two submissions were argued : alfie had the right to discharge himself and his parents were entitled to take him to italy . mr mylonas argued alfie is in hospital ‘for the purposes of receiving care and treatment in accordance with the court ’s order ’ therefore his liberty is not deprived . this can be supported in ferreira ‘a person is not being deprived of their liberty where they are receiving treatment and are physically restricted by their physical infirmities ’. furthermore , hayden j stated that ‘habeas corpus applies only to individuals unlawfully detained or whose civil liberties have been compromised in some way ’, therefore the application was ‘entirely misconceived ’ as not applicable to alfie . whilst the trust ’s care plan had approval from alfie ’s guardian , mr evans objected against the plan . with a ‘viscerally engaged army of facebook supporters ’, it can be said mr evans wanted what he felt was right . <nl> <nl> in gard , the judge stated welfare of the child shall be the paramount consideration in any question concerning the upbringing of the child in any proceedings . this is ‘stronger than ’ in all actions concerning children , the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration . although the 1989 children ’s act allows parents to make decisions about medical treatment where the child cannot consent , if the child is at risk of harm , such as in the present case , the state can intervene . <nl> the christian legal centre argued ‘by preventing further treatment of alfie , alder hey and the courts are compelling alfie to die ’. treloar argued ‘removal of parental authority as a result of referral to the high court is wrong , and deeply unjust ’. mr pavel stroilov provided a letter to the father , stating ‘to come to the hospital with a team of medical professionals with their own life support equipment and move alfie ’. it was concluded that the letter was misleading as false advice was given . <nl> as ‘alfie is now breathing independently ’, mr diamond argued on behalf of the father , ‘the removal of the ventilator and his italian citizenship are changes of events justifying a reconsideration ’. whereas , mr jason coppel on behalf of the mother , argued ‘it is a fundamental right under eu law to access services in any other member state ’ therefore alfie is obliged to free movement within the european union . however , the judge ruled allowing him to travel is ‘fundamentally against the core principle ’ of the court . although the public are surprised that alfie is breathing , ‘it is not a surprise to the doctors who deal with individuals from whom treatment is withdrawn ’. <nl> the ratio decidendi held there was no significant change , therefore the application had no substance . only relevant consideration were alfie ’s best interests , and the impact was ‘not a matter that the court could take into account ’. the habeas corpus was used as a tool to argue for the same outcome , but it does not change the fact that the ‘parents’ views were not determinative ’. therefore , the permission to appeal was refused . <nl> with a global awareness of the case , sir david henshaw said , ‘staff have endured a \"barrage\" of abuse ’. the tensions resulted into ‘aggressive demonstrations outside the hospital , and threats of the hospital being stormed resulted in police intervention ’. campaigners now support charlie ’s law and alfie ’s law , arguing parents need better rights in the law regarding medical decisions .\n",
